			<h5>Interpretation of Flow Patterns:</h5>
			
			<!-- Then the longer analysis paragraphs -->
    <p class="card-text">There are a lot of flows throughout the central United States. Oklahoma is receiving multiple of the larger flow lines on the entire map. Florida and California are not receiving a lot of flows. However, Florida and California are not sending any flows - just receiving. Iowa, Missouri, and Texas are a few states that are receiving many flows (but not necessarily large flows like Oklahoma). These same states are also sending out a lot of flows. </p>
	<p class="card-text">In the context of the flow lines, there is not one clear, overarching flow direction. There is a lot of flow activity in the midwest/central southern states, some activity in the east, and very little in the west. Though, it is important to remember that this map is only showing the top 100 flows. This flow activity is also reflected by the size/color of nodes. The nodes are total flow → flow in combined with flow out (not the difference like net flow). Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and Missouri all have the greatest flow totals. </p>
	<p class="card-text">Looking at the choropleth map - which accounts for all flow data as net flows, so where the family trees actually end up at the end of the 1887-1924 time from - you can see a very clear general flow direction of family trees from East to West. The green states are the states that have positive net flow. The purple states are the states that have negative net flow of family trees - dark purple being greater loss than light purple. The West, Southwest, and Florida are all dark green - they have the highest positive net flow. The Midwest/Central US states are mostly dark purple - they have the greatest negative net flow. The East has mostly light purple states - they have negative net flow but not as much loss as the Midwest. The subpatterns from East to West show that net flow decreases then increases, but the overarching general pattern is higher net flow as you go West. </p>
	<p class="card-text">It is misleading that the middle of the US has the most flow lines/movement as well as big “total flow” nodes, yet it lost the most families. And that the West US has the least flow lines/movement as well as small total flow nodes, yet it gained the most families. I think that these “conflicting” patterns align because everyone is migrating West, but not all at the same time as each other and not all in one shot. The Midwest probably shows a lot of activity because it truly did have a lot of activity. Within the time frame, families from the East could have moved into the Midwest and then moved again to the West. Pair this with Midwest families also moving West, and it explains the East to West pattern of small negative net flow, to large negative netflow, to positive net flow. It appears discontinuous but makes sense.
